# Stock Interval Performance API

EARLY DEVELOPMENT

This API will allow you to see the variance in stock performance over smaller time intervals within a chosen date interval. The idea is to give you the worst and best times (and other points in between) you could have bought a stock historically for a range of hold times. For instance, it could tell you that the best interval to have held a given stock for one month would have been October to November of 2005, while the best interval to have held that stock for two months was December to February of 2011.

## Usage

Choose a date interval, maximum interval length and time resolution, then specify the performance percentiles you're looking for.
